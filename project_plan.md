# CodeSensei Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**Goal**:  
To develop a Streamlit-based Python application that acts as a programming assistant by interacting with OpenAI's APIs. It will provide features such as code generation, debugging help, optimization, and explanations for Python applications.

**Key Features**:
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Connect with OpenAI's models to generate and review Python code.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Use Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive front end.  
- **Customizable Prompts**: Allow users to tweak prompts for tailored results.  
- **Code Debugging and Optimization**: Suggest fixes or optimizations for user-submitted code.  
- **Code Snippet Management**: Provide options to save, edit, and reuse generated code.  
- **Offline Code Execution (Optional)**: Allow testing snippets locally (via subprocess or sandboxing).

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Backend**: Python  
- **APIs**: OpenAI API for GPT-4/other models  
- **Package Management**: `pip` or `poetry`  
- **Database (Optional)**: SQLite or JSON for saving user prompts and generated code snippets locally.

- Text input boxes for prompts and code.  
- Buttons for actions (e.g., generate, debug, optimize).  
- Tabs for different features (e.g., generation, debugging, optimization).  
- Display areas for output (formatted text or tables).  

### Backend (Python)

**APIs**:  
- Wrapper module for OpenAI API.  

**Code Logic**:  
- Functions for generation, explanation, debugging, and optimization.  

**Storage**:  
- Save/load prompts and generated snippets.
